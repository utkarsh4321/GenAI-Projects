## Introduction
Generative AI is an exciting field that involves creating machines capable of producing content, whether it's text, images, or other types of data. This repository aims to bring together a diverse collection of generative AI projects, ranging from text-generation tools for websites and mobile apps to custom machine learning models that push the boundaries of creativity.

<div id="projects"></div>

## Projects

### Text Generation Tool for Websites/Extensions
Create and contribute text-generation tools that can be easily integrated into websites. This could include chatbots, content generators, or other applications that leverage generative AI to enhance user experience.

### Mobile App Text Generation
Develop mobile applications that use generative AI to generate creative and contextually relevant text. These apps could be anything from storytelling apps to AI-powered writing assistants.

### Custom ML Models
Experiment with and share your own custom machine learning models in the generative AI domain. This might involve training models on unique datasets, exploring novel architectures, or combining generative AI techniques with other fields.

#### *feel free to share your own ideas on what you want to do or what could be done!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
